# Movesense Android Binding

This folder contains the implementation of the Xamarin bindings project that wraps the native Android MDSlib.aar library.

The output from this project has been published on NuGet, but you do not need to reference that package directly in your projects - it is added as a dependency of Plugin.Movesense.
